Electricity is the set of physical phenomena associated with the presence and motion of matter that has a property of electric charge In early days electricity was considered as being unrelated to magnetism Later on many experimental results and the development of Maxwell s equations indicated that both electricity and magnetism are from a single phenomenon electromagnetism Various common phenomena are related to electricity including lightning static electricity electric heating electric discharges and many others 
The presence of an electric charge which can be either positive or negative produces an electric field The movement of electric charges is an electric current and produces a magnetic field 
When a charge is placed in a location with a non zero electric field a force will act on it The magnitude of this force is given by Coulomb s law Thus if that charge were to move the electric field would be doing work on the electric charge Thus we can speak of electric potential at a certain point in space which is equal to the work done by an external agent in carrying a unit of positive charge from an arbitrarily chosen reference point to that point without any acceleration and is typically measured in volts 
Electricity is at the heart of many modern technologies being used for Electrical phenomena have been studied since antiquity though progress in theoretical understanding remained slow until the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries Even then practical applications for electricity were few and it would not be until the late nineteenth century that electrical engineers were able to put it to industrial and residential use The rapid expansion in electrical technology at this time transformed industry and society becoming a driving force for the Second Industrial Revolution Electricity s extraordinary versatility means it can be put to an almost limitless set of applications which include transport heating lighting communications and computation Electrical power is now the backbone of modern industrial society Long before any knowledge of electricity existed people were aware of shocks from electric fish Ancient Egyptian texts dating from BCE referred to these fish as the Thunderer of the Nile and described them as the protectors of all other fish Electric fish were again reported millennia later by ancient Greek Roman and Arabic naturalists and physicians Several ancient writers such as Pliny the Elder and Scribonius Largus attested to the numbing effect of electric shocks delivered by electric catfish and electric rays and knew that such shocks could travel along conducting objects Patients suffering from ailments such as gout or headache were directed to touch electric fish in the hope that the powerful jolt might cure them Possibly the earliest and nearest approach to the discovery of the identity of lightning and electricity from any other source is to be attributed to the Arabs who before the th century had the Arabic word for lightning ra ad applied to the electric ray 
Ancient cultures around the Mediterranean knew that certain objects such as rods of amber could be rubbed with cat s fur to attract light objects like feathers Thales of Miletus made a series of observations on static electricity around BCE from which he believed that friction rendered amber magnetic in contrast to minerals such as magnetite which needed no rubbing Thales was incorrect in believing the attraction was due to a magnetic effect but later science would prove a link between magnetism and electricity According to a controversial theory the Parthians may have had knowledge of electroplating based on the discovery of the Baghdad Battery which resembles a galvanic cell though it is uncertain whether the artifact was electrical in nature 
The presence of charge gives rise to an electrostatic force charges exert a force on each other an effect that was known though not understood in antiquity A lightweight ball suspended from a string can be charged by touching it with a glass rod that has itself been charged by rubbing with a cloth If a similar ball is charged by the same glass rod it is found to repel the first the charge acts to force the two balls apart Two balls that are charged with a rubbed amber rod also repel each other However if one ball is charged by the glass rod and the other by an amber rod the two balls are found to attract each other These phenomena were investigated in the late eighteenth century by Charles Augustin de Coulomb who deduced that charge manifests itself in two opposing forms This discovery led to the well known axiom like charged objects repel and opposite charged objects attract 
The force acts on the charged particles themselves hence charge has a tendency to spread itself as evenly as possible over a conducting surface The magnitude of the electromagnetic force whether attractive or repulsive is given by Coulomb s law which relates the force to the product of the charges and has an inverse square relation to the distance between them The electromagnetic force is very strong second only in strength to the strong interaction but unlike that force it operates over all distances In comparison with the much weaker gravitational force the electromagnetic force pushing two electrons apart is times that of the gravitational attraction pulling them together 
Study has shown that the origin of charge is from certain types of subatomic particles which have the property of electric charge Electric charge gives rise to and interacts with the electromagnetic force one of the four fundamental forces of nature The most familiar carriers of electrical charge are the electron and proton Experiment has shown charge to be a conserved quantity that is the net charge within an electrically isolated system will always remain constant regardless of any changes taking place within that system Within the system charge may be transferred between bodies either by direct contact or by passing along a conducting material such as a wire The informal term static electricity refers to the net presence or imbalance of charge on a body usually caused when dissimilar materials are rubbed together transferring charge from one to the other 
The charge on electrons and protons is opposite in sign hence an amount of charge may be expressed as being either negative or positive By convention the charge carried by electrons is deemed negative and that by protons positive a custom that originated with the work of Benjamin Franklin The amount of charge is usually given the symbol Q and expressed in coulombs each electron carries the same charge of approximately coulomb The proton has a charge that is equal and opposite and thus coulomb Charge is possessed not just by matter but also by antimatter each antiparticle bearing an equal and opposite charge to its corresponding particle 
Charge can be measured by a number of means an early instrument being the gold leaf electroscope which although still in use for classroom demonstrations has been superseded by the electronic electrometer 
Electric current
Main article Electric current
The movement of electric charge is known as an electric current the intensity of which is usually measured in amperes Current can consist of any moving charged particles most commonly these are electrons but any charge in motion constitutes a current Electric current can flow through some things electrical conductors but will not flow through an electrical insulator 
By historical convention a positive current is defined as having the same direction of flow as any positive charge it contains or to flow from the most positive part of a circuit to the most negative part Current defined in this manner is called conventional current The motion of negatively charged electrons around an electric circuit one of the most familiar forms of current is thus deemed positive in the opposite direction to that of the electrons However depending on the conditions an electric current can consist of a flow of charged particles in either direction or even in both directions at once The positive to negative convention is widely used to simplify this situation

An electric arc provides an energetic demonstration of electric current
The process by which electric current passes through a material is termed electrical conduction and its nature varies with that of the charged particles and the material through which they are travelling Examples of electric currents include metallic conduction where electrons flow through a conductor such as metal and electrolysis where ions charged atoms flow through liquids or through plasmas such as electrical sparks While the particles themselves can move quite slowly sometimes with an average drift velocity only fractions of a millimetre per second the electric field that drives them itself propagates at close to the speed of light enabling electrical signals to pass rapidly along wires 
Current causes several observable effects which historically were the means of recognising its presence That water could be decomposed by the current from a voltaic pile was discovered by Nicholson and Carlisle in a process now known as electrolysis Their work was greatly expanded upon by Michael Faraday in Current through a resistance causes localised heating an effect James Prescott Joule studied mathematically in One of the most important discoveries relating to current was made accidentally by Hans Christian Ørsted in when while preparing a lecture he witnessed the current in a wire disturbing the needle of a magnetic compass He had discovered electromagnetism a fundamental interaction between electricity and magnetics The level of electromagnetic emissions generated by electric arcing is high enough to produce electromagnetic interference which can be detrimental to the workings of adjacent equipment 
In engineering or household applications current is often described as being either direct current DC or alternating current AC These terms refer to how the current varies in time Direct current as produced by example from a battery and required by most electronic devices is a unidirectional flow from the positive part of a circuit to the negative If as is most common this flow is carried by electrons they will be travelling in the opposite direction Alternating current is any current that reverses direction repeatedly almost always this takes the form of a sine wave Alternating current thus pulses back and forth within a conductor without the charge moving any net distance over time The time averaged value of an alternating current is zero but it delivers energy in first one direction and then the reverse Alternating current is affected by electrical properties that are not observed under steady state direct current such as inductance and capacitance These properties however can become important when circuitry is subjected to transients such as when first energised 
Electric circuits
Main article Electric circuit
A basic electric circuit The voltage source V on the left drives a current I around the circuit delivering electrical energy into the resistor R From the resistor the current returns to the source completing the circuit 
An electric circuit is an interconnection of electric components such that electric charge is made to flow along a closed path a circuit usually to perform some useful task 
The components in an electric circuit can take many forms which can include elements such as resistors capacitors switches transformers and electronics Electronic circuits contain active components usually semiconductors and typically exhibit non linear behaviour requiring complex analysis The simplest electric components are those that are termed passive and linear while they may temporarily store energy they contain no sources of it and exhibit linear responses to stimuli 
The resistor is perhaps the simplest of passive circuit elements as its name suggests it resists the current through it dissipating its energy as heat The resistance is a consequence of the motion of charge through a conductor in metals for example resistance is primarily due to collisions between electrons and ions Ohm s law is a basic law of circuit theory stating that the current passing through a resistance is directly proportional to the potential difference across it The resistance of most materials is relatively constant over a range of temperatures and currents materials under these conditions are known as ohmic The ohm the unit of resistance was named in honour of Georg Ohm and is symbolised by the Greek letter O O is the resistance that will produce a potential difference of one volt in response to a current of one amp 
The capacitor is a development of the Leyden jar and is a device that can store charge and thereby storing electrical energy in the resulting field It consists of two conducting plates separated by a thin insulating dielectric layer in practice thin metal foils are coiled together increasing the surface area per unit volume and therefore the capacitance The unit of capacitance is the farad named after Michael Faraday and given the symbol F one farad is the capacitance that develops a potential difference of one volt when it stores a charge of one coulomb A capacitor connected to a voltage supply initially causes a current as it accumulates charge this current will however decay in time as the capacitor fills eventually falling to zero A capacitor will therefore not permit a steady state current but instead blocks it 
The inductor is a conductor usually a coil of wire that stores energy in a magnetic field in response to the current through it When the current changes the magnetic field does too inducing a voltage between the ends of the conductor The induced voltage is proportional to the time rate of change of the current The constant of proportionality is termed the inductance The unit of inductance is the henry named after Joseph Henry a contemporary of Faraday One henry is the inductance that will induce a potential difference of one volt if the current through it changes at a rate of one ampere per second The inductor s behaviour is in some regards converse to that of the capacitor it will freely allow an unchanging current but opposes a rapidly changing one 
Electric power
Main article electric power
Electric power is the rate at which electric energy is transferred by an electric circuit The SI unit of power is the watt one joule per second 
Electric power like mechanical power is the rate of doing work measured in watts and represented by the letter P The term wattage is used colloquially to mean electric power in watts The electric power in watts produced by an electric current I consisting of a charge of Q coulombs every t seconds passing through an electric potential voltage difference of V is

t is time in seconds
I is electric current in amperes
V is electric potential or voltage in volts
Electricity generation is often done with electric generators but can also be supplied by chemical sources such as electric batteries or by other means from a wide variety of sources of energy Electric power is generally supplied to businesses and homes by the electric power industry Electricity is usually sold by the kilowatt hour MJ which is the product of power in kilowatts multiplied by running time in hours Electric utilities measure power using electricity meters which keep a running total of the electric energy delivered to a customer Unlike fossil fuels electricity is a low entropy form of energy and can be converted into motion or many other forms of energy with high efficiency

Surface mount electronic components
Electronics deals with electrical circuits that involve active electrical components such as vacuum tubes transistors diodes optoelectronics sensors and integrated circuits and associated passive interconnection technologies The nonlinear behaviour of active components and their ability to control electron flows makes amplification of weak signals possible and electronics is widely used in information processing telecommunications and signal processing The ability of electronic devices to act as switches makes digital information processing possible Interconnection technologies such as circuit boards electronics packaging technology and other varied forms of communication infrastructure complete circuit functionality and transform the mixed components into a regular working system 
Today most electronic devices use semiconductor components to perform electron control The study of semiconductor devices and related technology is considered a branch of solid state physics whereas the design and construction of electronic circuits to solve practical problems come under electronics engineering 
A refrigerator colloquially fridge consists of a thermally insulated compartment and a heat pump mechanical electronic or chemical that transfers heat from the inside of the fridge to its external environment so that the inside of the fridge is cooled to a temperature below the room temperature Refrigeration is an essential food storage technique in developed countries The lower temperature lowers the reproduction rate of bacteria so the refrigerator reduces the rate of spoilage A refrigerator maintains a temperature a few degrees above the freezing point of water Optimum temperature range for perishable food storage is to C to F A similar device that maintains a temperature below the freezing point of water is called a freezer The refrigerator replaced the icebox which had been a common household appliance for almost a century and a half 
The first cooling systems for food involved ice Artificial refrigeration began in the mid s and developed in the early s In the first working vapor compression refrigeration system was built The first commercial ice making machine was invented in In refrigerators for home use were invented In Frigidaire introduced the first self contained unit The introduction of Freon in the s expanded the refrigerator market during the s Home freezers as separate compartments larger than necessary just for ice cubes were introduced in Frozen foods previously a luxury item became commonplace 
Freezer units are used in households and in industry and commerce Commercial refrigerator and freezer units were in use for almost years prior to the common home models The freezer on top and refrigerator on bottom style had been the basic style since the s until modern refrigerators broke the trend A vapor compression cycle is used in most household refrigerators refrigerator freezers and freezers Newer refrigerators may include automatic defrosting chilled water and ice from a dispenser in the door 
Domestic refrigerators and freezers for food storage are made in a range of sizes Among the smallest are Peltier type refrigerators designed to chill beverages A large domestic refrigerator stands as tall as a person and may be about m wide with a capacity of L Refrigerators and freezers may be free standing or built into a kitchen The refrigerator allows the modern household to keep food fresh for longer than before Freezers allow people to buy food in bulk and eat it at leisure and bulk purchases save money 
Domestic refrigerators and freezers for food storage are made in a range of sizes Among the smallest is a L Peltier refrigerator advertised as being able to hold cans of beer A large domestic refrigerator stands as tall as a person and may be about m wide with a capacity of L Some models for small households fit under kitchen work surfaces usually about cm high Refrigerators may be combined with freezers either stacked with refrigerator or freezer above below or side by side A refrigerator without a frozen food storage compartment may have a small section just to make ice cubes Freezers may have drawers to store food in or they may have no divisions chest freezers 
A central heating system provides warmth to the whole interior of a building or portion of a building from one point to multiple rooms When combined with other systems in order to control the building climate the whole system may be an HVAC heating ventilation and air conditioning system 
Central heating differs from space heating in that the heat generation occurs in one place such as a furnace room or basement in a house or a mechanical room in a large building though not necessarily at the geometrically central point The heat is distributed throughout the building typically by forced air through ductwork by water circulating through pipes or by steam fed through pipes The most common method of heat generation involves the combustion of fossil fuel in a furnace or boiler 
In much of the temperate climate zone most detached housing has had central heating installed since before the Second World War Where coal was readily available i e the anthracite coal region in northeast Pennsylvania coal fired steam or hot water systems were common Later in the th century these were updated to burn fuel oil or gas eliminating the need for a large coal storage bin near the boiler and the need to remove and discard coal ashes Coal fired systems are now mostly reserved for larger buildings 
A cheaper alternative to hot water or steam heat is forced hot air A furnace burns fuel oil which heats air in a heat exchanger and blower fans circulate the warmed air through a network of ducts to the rooms in the building This system is cheaper because the air moves through a series of ducts instead of pipes and does not require a pipe fitter to install The space between floor joists can be boxed in and used as some of the ductwork further lowering costs 
The four different generations of district heating systems and their energy sources
Electrical heating systems occur less commonly and are practical only with low cost electricity or when ground source heat pumps are used Considering the combined system of thermal power station and electric resistance heating the overall efficiency will be less than for direct use of fossil fuel for space heating 
Some other buildings utilize central solar heating in which case the distribution system normally uses water circulation 
Alternatives to such systems are gas heaters and district heating District heating uses the waste heat from an industrial process or electrical generating plant to provide heat for neighboring buildings Similar to cogeneration this requires underground piping to circulate hot water or steam 
The energy source selected for a central heating system varies by region The primary energy source is selected on the basis of cost convenience efficiency and reliability The energy cost of heating is one of the main costs of operating a building in a cold climate Some central heating plants can switch fuels for reasons of economy and convenience for example a home owner may install a wood fired furnace with electrical backup for occasional unattended operation 
Solid fuels such as wood peat or coal can be stockpiled at the point of use but are inconvenient to handle and difficult to automatically control Wood fuel is still used where the supply is plentiful and the occupants of the building don t mind the work involved in hauling in fuel removing ashes and tending the fire Pellet fuel systems can automatically stoke the fire but still need manual removal of ash Coal was once an important residential heating fuel but today is rarely found 
Liquid fuels are petroleum products such as heating oil and kerosene These are still widely applied where other heat sources are unavailable Fuel oil can be automatically fired in a central heating system and requires no ash removal and little maintenance of the combustion system However the variable price of oil on world markets leads to erratic and high prices compared to some other energy sources Institutional heating systems office buildings or schools for example can use low grade inexpensive bunker fuel to run their heating plants but capital cost is high compared to more easily managed liquid fuels 
Natural gas is a widespread heating fuel in North America and northern Europe Gas burners are automatically controlled and require no ash removal and little maintenance However not all areas have access to a natural gas distribution system Liquified petroleum gas or propane can be stored at the point of use and periodically replenished by a truck mounted mobile tank 
Some areas have low cost electric power making electric heating economically practical Electric heating can either be purely resistance type heating or make use of a heat pump system to take advantage of low grade heat in the air or ground 
A district heating system uses centrally located boilers or water heaters and circulates heat energy to individual customers by circulating hot water or steam This has the advantage of a central highly efficient energy converter than can use the best available pollution controls and that is professionally operated The district heating system can use heat sources impractical to deploy to individual homes such as heavy oil wood byproducts or hypothetically nuclear fission The distribution network is more costly to build than for gas or electric heating and so is only found in densely populated areas or compact communities 
Not all central heating systems require purchased energy A few buildings are served by local geothermal heat using hot water or steam from a local well to provide building heat Such areas are uncommon A passive solar system requires no purchased fuel but needs to be carefully designed for the site 
Calculating output of heater required
A key is a device that is used to operate a lock such as to lock or unlock it A typical key is a small piece of metal consisting of two parts the bit or blade which slides into the keyway of the lock and distinguishes between different keys and the bow which is left protruding so that torque can be applied by the user In its simplest implementation a key operates one lock or set of locks that are keyed alike a lock key system where each similarly keyed lock requires the same unique key The key serves as a security token for access to the locked area only persons having the correct key can open the lock and gain access In more complex mechanical lock key systems two different keys one of which is known as the master key serve to open the lock Common metals include brass plated brass nickel silver and steel 
The lever tumbler lock which uses a set of levers to prevent the bolt from moving in the lock was invented by Robert Barron in His double acting lever lock required the lever to be lifted to a certain height by having a slot cut in the lever so lifting the lever too far was as bad as not lifting the lever far enough This type of lock is still used today 
Diagram of a Chubb detector lock
The lever tumbler lock was greatly improved by Jeremiah Chubb in A burglary in Portsmouth Dockyard prompted the British Government to announce a competition to produce a lock that could be opened only with its own key citation needed Chubb developed the Chubb detector lock which incorporated an integral security feature that could frustrate unauthorized access attempts and would indicate to the lock s owner if it had been interfered with Chubb was awarded after a trained lock picker failed to break the lock after months 
In Jeremiah joined his brother Charles in starting their own lock company Chubb Chubb made various improvements to his lock his improved design didn t require a special regulator key to reset the lock by his keys used six levers rather than four and he later introduced a disc that allowed the key to pass but narrowed the field of view hiding the levers from anybody attempting to pick the lock The Chubb brothers also received a patent for the first burglar resisting safe and began production in 
The pin tumbler lock uses a set of pins to prevent the lock from opening unless the correct key is inserted The key has a series of grooves on either side of the key s blade that limit the type of lock the key can slide into As the key slides into the lock the horizontal grooves on the blade align with the wards in the keyway allowing or denying entry to the cylinder A series of pointed teeth and notches on the blade called bittings then allow pins to move up and down until they are in line with the shear line of the inner and outer cylinder allowing the cylinder or cam to rotate freely and the lock to open 
Radiators are heat exchangers used to transfer thermal energy from one medium to another for the purpose of cooling and heating The majority of radiators are constructed to function in automobiles buildings and electronics The radiator is always a source of heat to its environment although this may be for either the purpose of heating this environment or for cooling the fluid or coolant supplied to it as for engine cooling Despite the name most radiators transfer the bulk of their heat via convection instead of thermal radiation 
The Roman hypocaust is an early example of a type of radiator for building space heating Franz San Galli a Prussian born Russian businessman living in St Petersburg is credited with inventing the heating radiator around having received a radiator patent in but American Joseph Nason developed a primitive radiator in and received a number of U S patents for hot water and steam heating
